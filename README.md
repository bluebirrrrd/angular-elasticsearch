# Angular-elasticsearch

This is a project for trying out elasticsearch :)

## Setting up backend
To make everything work, you need to [instal Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html). After installation, keep it running.

Go to `backend` folder and do `npm install` in your terminal. Then run `node index.js` to copy the recipes to your elasticsearch database.

## Running frontend

Just go to `frontend` folder and run `npm install`, and then `npm start`.
